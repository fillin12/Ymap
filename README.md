# Ymap_mean_ploidy.py

### [Ymap](http://lovelace.cs.umn.edu/Ymap/) is a software that enables the user to visualize DDRadseq data acquired from the commensal fungus C. albicans strain SC5314 in a succinct and compact format. The software allows visualization of genomic traits like ploidy, copy number variation (CNV) and can also be used to find recombination events that result from pseudomeiosis that occurs during mating. 

### This program will calculate the average CNV or ploidy across every chromosome in a dataset acquired from Ymap data, or it can calculate the CNV and ploidy in a specific location.
